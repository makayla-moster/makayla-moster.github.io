<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<br>

<!-- <img src="./assets/images/IMG_1715.png" alt="" width="60%" style="margin:auto;"> <br> -->

<p>Hiya! My name is Makayla Moster and I'm a <strong>Computer Science Ph.D. Student at
  Clemson University</strong>. I am a member of the <a href="http://clemsonhfse.com/index.html" target="_blank">Human Factors Software Engineering</a> (HFSE) lab
  under the guidance of <a href="http://paigerodeghero.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Paige Rodeghero</a>. </p>

  <p> I graduated from the University of North Carolina Wilmington with my B.S. with Honors in Computer
  Science in May 2019. I also have completed my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2021 and my Graduate Certificate in Engineering and Science Education in December 2022, both from Clemson University.
  </p>
  <p>
  In my spare time, I mostly enjoy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mmakayla" target="_blank">reading novels</a>, playing videogames, and spending time with my kitten, Gizmo. I dabble in crafting; I am a tie dye enthusiast and a hobby crocheter. 
  I also have 20+ plants that I'm surprised are still alive. 
<p>
