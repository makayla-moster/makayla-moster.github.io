  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <!--<p><img src="assets/images/mak.png" alt="Makayla" width="50%" height="auto" class="center"></p>-->
  <!-- <p>Will update this soon.<p> -->
  <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy <!--<a href="books.html">-->reading novels<!--</a>-->, tending to my houseplants,
   playing video games, and trying new recipes.</p>

    <h2>Clemson, SC</h2>
    <p>I started my combined Masters and PhD in Computer Science at Clemson
      University in August 2019. I joined the <a href="http://clemsonhfse.com/index.html" target="_blank">HFSE</a> lab
      under the direction of <a href="http://paigerodeghero.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Paige Rodeghero</a> during the Summer of 2020.</p>

    <h2>Wilmington, NC</h2>
    <p><img src="assets/images/beach.jpg" alt="Wilmington" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
    <p>I moved to Wilmington after graduating high school to attend the
    University of North Carolina at Wilmington. I graduated with my B.S. Honors
    in Computer Science with a Digital Arts concentration in May 2019.</p>
    <p>During my undergraduate career, I was an active member of the SIGGRAPH
    and the Math &amp; Stats club. I participated in a few outreach programs such
    as volunteering for Science Olympiad and Watson College of Education's STEAM
    Celebration. I also served as an Engineering Expectations summer camp
    instructor for 2 years.</p>

    <h2>Muenster, TX</h2>
    <p>Muenster is my hometown, and I graduated from Muenster High School in
    May 2015. During my high school career, I was very active in UIL,
    taking AP classes, being on the yearbook team, playing the flute in the
    Fighting Hornet Marching Band, and spending my Saturdays shelving books
    at the Bettie M. Luke Public Library.</p>
