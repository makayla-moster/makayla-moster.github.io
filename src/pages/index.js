      <p className='pb-5'>My research focuses on <span className="text-cyan-500">teamwork</span>, <span className="text-cyan-500">computer-mediated communication tools</span>, and <span className="text-cyan-500">informal learning communities</span>. 
        I have two goals with my research: 1) I want to further our understanding of informal online education-based communities and how/if they impact studentsâ€™ formal education, and 2) I want to improve the student teamwork experience through CMC tools. 
        My hope is to help further our understanding of informal learning communities and ways to improve the learning experience for everyone.</p>

      <p className='pb-5'>In my limited spare time, I mostly enjoy reading novels and playing videogames. I also dabble in crafting; I am a tie dye enthusiast, a hobby crocheter, and sew bandanas for my cat. Lastly, I enjoy going on walks with my <span className="text-cyan-500 hover:opacity-60"><Link to="https://michael-byrd.github.io" target="_blank">husband</Link></span> and cat, Gizmo.</p>
