  <p>Welcome to my first real blog post. In this post, I'll be talking about my
  anaglyph creator that I wrote in Python.</p>

  <h3>First, what is an anaglyph?</h3>

  <p>An anaglyph is a stereoscopic image, or composed of two images taken slightly apart
     from each other (like how your eyes see!), in which both images are superimposed
     and are two different colors (usually cyan and red). If you look at this image through colored filters (like 3D glasses),
     then the image will 'pop out' of the screen.</p>

    <p>Anaglyphs have been used since the 1850's, starting with Joseph D'Almeida who invented a methodology for
    showing stereoscopic images to multiple people at once. They have been used to create 3D images and even
    for some early 3D movies. You can read more on the history of anaglyphs
    <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2016/11/21/what-on-earth-is-an-anaglyph/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Some Examples!</h3>

    <img style="width: 50%; float: left;" src="/assets/images/left.jpg" alt="Left image of flowers">

    <img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="/assets/images/right.jpg" alt="Right image of flowers">

    <img style="clear: both; width: 50%;" class="center" src="/assets/images/FinalAnaglyph2.png" alt="Final combined anaglyph image of flowers"> <br><br><br>

    <img style="width: 50%; float: left;" src="/assets/images/left1.jpg" alt="Left image of desk">

    <img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="/assets/images/right1.jpg" alt="Right image of desk">

    <img style="clear: both; width: 50%;" class="center" src="/assets/images/FinalAnaglyph1.png" alt="Final combined anaglyph image of desk"> <br><br>

    <h3>How was this done?</h3>
    <p>To complete this project, I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org" target="_blank">numpy</a>
    libraries. I read in my left and right images using OpenCV and then created a slightly larger empty image array using numpy to
    store the two overlapping images
    as a final anaglyph. I used an offset of 5 pixels for the images above. <br>
    I then iterate through the two images, taking the blue and green channel from the left and the red channel from the right, saving the red pixels
    as normal and then offsetting the blue and green pixels by an offset amount. I then save and preview the image.
    </p>

    <h3>Pretty simple! And super cool!</h3>
