<p> Oh, wow, where did Summer 2021 go?? <!--more--> </p>

<h2>#Research4Dayz</h2>
<p>It's been a hectic summer over here, I've been working on three-ish research projects and a summer camp all summer.
I helped out with <a href="https://codeatclemson.com/" target="_blank">Computer Game Coding Camp for Autism</a> by being a TA and teaching a day's worth of material to the students!
Teaching them was exciting as I had never really been in front of a classroom teaching before. Sure as a TA I've stood at the front of the classroom and directed my students, but never
taught them how to do something, answer questions about it, and whatnot. So that was a super cool experience and I can't wait to continue working with CGCC. (If interested in volunteering, feel free
to reach out to <a href="mailto:cgcc@clemson.edu">cgcc@clemson.edu</a>!)
</p>

<p>
Besides that, I've been doing research on two other projects that I'm really excited about and can't wait to share the results as soon as I can. Stay tuned for those projects!

<h2>#Summer?</h2>

<p>I have been fortunate enough to take some time off this summer, I went home to see my family and hang out with some friends for 10 days or so before school started back.
It was a nice little break, however I think that summer was too short and wish that we hadn't gone back to school, lol. I also finished my <code>#ReadingGoals</code>  (It was only 15 books, but I'm glad I met it!),
crocheted some flowers (which I haven't finished), got into exercise (gross!), cooked some new meals (delicious), and chilled in my apartment. Oh! And I also was a student volunteer for ICSE 2021! That was pretty cool, I helped out with
the colocated conference FormaliSE, which was pretty interesting.</p>

<h2>#Fall2021Semester</h2>

<p>So we're back in person with full capacity classes, and that makes me nervous. Luckily, all the classes I'm taking are online so I don't have to worry too too much - however my boyfriend's classes and teaching are in-person, so I still worry.
 I should really say class, as I only am taking one course and a bajillion research hours (not really, only 6 but it feels like it).
 My class is called Teaching Undergraduate Engineering, which I'm really excited for. My future goal is to eventually
become a university professor, and I think this class is the first step in that direction. The first session was interesting and I can't wait to dive into the rest of the content.</p>

<p>This summer, I got back into exercising with Nintendo's RingFit video game. I tried playing it at least 5 times per week for 30 minutes, which I am proud to say that I was pretty successful at. Exercising
  at home is kind of weird since we've been conditioned to confine exercise to a 'gym,' but instead I'm working out in my living room with a pilates ring, yoga mat, and in bare feet. However, now that
school's back in session I have started walking on the treadmill at the gym. My first time at the gym since 2016-ish was this past Wednesday, and I'm glad I went and walked for half an hour.
Hopefully I can keep this up and lose those quarantine pounds!</p>

<p>This was just a small life update, but I'm interested to know how was your summer? Leave a comment below!</p>
