<p>Honey. Garlic? Porkchops? I know it sounds a little weird (at least to me), but you heard that right. Honey garlic porkchops.<!--more--></p>

<h2>Why this recipe?</h2>

<p>I've been looking for a way to change up the standard baked breaded porkchops I've been cooking for the past couple of years, and while
searching the internet, I found <a href="https://rasamalaysia.com/honey-garlic-pork-chops/" target="_blank">this recipe</a> from the blog <a href="https://rasamalaysia.com/" target="_blank">Rasa Malaysia</a>.
I thought this looked do-able from my very limited culinary experience and thought it might be something my boyfriend might be interested in eating. It also helped that there were only 5 ingredients required to make them!</p>

<h2>Was it hard to cook?</h2>

<p>The recipe recommends using a cast-iron skillet, and I, being a grad student, do not own one. So I substituted my handy-dandy regular skillet and they were super simple to cook. The ingredients are: honey, porkchops, minced garlic, butter, and vegetable oil.
  It took about 20 minutes (the recommended time is 15) for me to cook them from start to finish while also cooking potatoes and corn.</p>

<h2>Would we eat this again?</h2>
<p>Of course! It was really delicious. I've never used honey to cook dinner with before, and I found the recipe to be super straightforward and easy to follow.
I thought my boyfriend might have some apprehension when I told him I was making this as part of our dinner, but he was into it and excited to try something new. It's definitely a new
way to cook porkchops for us and one that will hang around in our weekly rotations!</p>
