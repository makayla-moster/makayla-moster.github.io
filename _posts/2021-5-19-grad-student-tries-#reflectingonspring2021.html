<p>Well, the Spring 2021 semester wrapped up for me at the end of April, and it's almost May so I figured I would write a small blog post about my experience. <!--more--> </p>

<h2>Class Load</h2>
<p>My class load was fairly light, I only had 7 credit hours of classes and 3 credit hours of research, which was odd for me. This was my first semester not taking
3+ lecture-style classes and it was a nice feeling.</p>

<p>However, to fill the gap left from the last class, I began to work on my research. This semester I learned how to
actually do qualitative research in a trial-by-fire format meaning that me and my collaborator jumped headfirst into qualitative research land with neither of us knowing
the first thing about qualitative research. However, this approach worked for us, we read a lot of how-to articles, enrolled in the free version of an EdX course that taught us
how to interview participants, take interview notes, and then analyze the transcripts and notes taken. But we survived and are planning on getting those results (and more after an expansion) published.</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<p>This semester, I applied for 2 Clemson-related fellowships, neither of which I received. However, I did get experience writing essays and interviewing, which are important.
  But that's okay, there will most definitely be other opportunities out there for me in the future.</p>

<p>On the bright side, I submitted my candidate exam, which consists of a portfolio of files: a research paper that's publication-worthy and mostly written by me, a grade of A in 3 core classes, 2 letters
of recommendation by faculty, a statement of purpose/personal statement, and optional files such as significant accomplishments and things like that. I submitted this at the end of March and last week I got an
email stating that I passed my exam! Which means that now I can start working towards my dissertation. Next major step: get a proposal together, but before then I need to get my advisory committee together and
figure out the scope of my dissertation.</p>

<p>I also received my Master's degree this semester! (I've already done a <a href="https://makayla-moster.github.io/announcements/gradschool/2021/05/06/grad-student-tries-masteringcomputerscience.html">blog post</a> on that though.)</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>Well, this summer I have multiple projects in the works, so hopefully I'll be submitting some papers in the coming months! I'm also going to be helping with <a href="https://codeatclemson.com/" target="_blank">Computer Game Coding Camp for Autism</a> this summer
as an instructor/content developer/researcher. Other than that, I'm trying to get through my TBR pile, playing RuneScape 3 and Age of Empires 2, as well as taking some time to relax.</p>

<p>Are you doing anything fun this summer? Have a cool project you're working on? Feel free to leave a comment below!</p>
