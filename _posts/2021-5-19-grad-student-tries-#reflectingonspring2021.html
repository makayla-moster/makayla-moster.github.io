<p>Well, the Spring 2021 semester wrapped up for me at the end of April, and it's almost May so I figured I would write a small blog post about my experience. <!--more--> </p>

<h2>Class Load</h2>
<p>My class load was fairly light, I only had 7 credit hours of classes and 3 credit hours of research, which was odd for me. This was my first semester not taking
3+ lecture-style classes and it was a nice feeling.</p>

<p>However, to fill the gap left from the last class, I began to work on my research. This semester I learned how to
actually do qualitative research in a trial-by-fire format meaning that me and my collaborator jumped headfirst into qualitative research land with neither of us knowing
the first thing about qualitative research. However, this approach worked for us, we read a lot of how-to articles, enrolled in the free version of an EdX course that taught us
how to interview participants, take interview notes, and then analyze the transcripts and notes taken. But we survived and are planning on getting those results (and more after an expansion) published.</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>
