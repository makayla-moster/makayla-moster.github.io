<p>I got my Masters degree in Computer Science yesterday! :)<!--more--></p>

<p style="padding-top:5%;"> I can now say that I 'Mastered' Computer Science. Lol. It's been a wild two years here at Clemson University, and I'm glad to announce that I graduated with my Clemson degree yesterday. I'd like to shoutout everyone who helped get me here,
but I'm pretty sure my following is fairly small or nonexistent. But thank you to my family, friends, lab, and my boyfriend for keeping me sane and supporting me for the last two years (and in the years to come). Y'all are great!
</p>

<h2>What do I do now?</h2>
 <p>My plan was to obtain my Master's degree en-route to my Ph.D. Which is exactly what I intend to do, so now I've got the rest of my Ph.D. to finish - which involves coming up with
 a novel research project and researching it for the next few years and writing my dissertation. I also plan on finishing Clemson's Engineering and Science Education Certificate program!
I'm sure I'll have some exciting stuff coming down the pipeline, so stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Am I doing anything cool over the summer?</h2>
<p>Research... and I'm working with really cool people to run the <a href="https://codeatclemson.com/" target="_blank">Computer Game Coding Camp</a>! (Check out the website, I helped create it!) <br><br>

Other than that, not much - blogging, recipe hunting, crafting, reading, all the usual things.</p>
