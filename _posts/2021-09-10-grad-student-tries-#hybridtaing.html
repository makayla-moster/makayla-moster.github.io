<p>This semester so far has been a whirlwind, and we just finished Week 4. </p>

<p>Currently, I’m a teaching assistant for an in-person senior-level course with a semester-long group project.
I run the lab sections where the students get into their groups and work on their project as well as do group check-ins (AKA scrums) with me each week.
Due to the pandemic, I’ve also had to adapt to being a hybrid lab instructor. For the class, there is a videoconferencing session that’s set up for students who are quarantined to utilize.</p>

<p>Hybrid courses sound like the best of both worlds, right?<!--more--></p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you agree with that statement, we currently don’t see eye-to-eye.
Hybrid courses force instructors to split their attention across multiple modalities, the students in the classroom –
who may be asking questions and chatting to the instructor - and the students in the video call – who might be using the chat feature, raising their hands, etc. to get the instructor’s attention.</p>

<p>Inclusion and accessibility are two things that I am currently learning
about in my Engineering and Science Education courses. Although <strong>I believe down to my core that all courses should be accessible to all students</strong>,
hybrid courses are not something I wish to have to teach again. However, I do think there are some positive aspects to holding hybrid courses:</p>

<h3>Pros of Hybrid courses:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>For students:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Convenient</li>
  <li>Stops the spread of germs</li>
  <li>Can mute camera/mic </li>
  <li>Can be multitasking/not paying attention</li>
</ul>
  <li>For professors:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Stops the spread of germs</li>
  <li>Allows students to stay on track in the course if they must miss</li>
  <li>Automatic nametags on faces</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>I think that with some proper finagling, hybrid courses could work, but in the uncertainty of a pandemic, I think that it just makes a professor’s job more difficult than it needs to be. For example, in my classroom there is a semester long project that these teams are working on each day in lab. Some students must attend lab via videoconference due to their status as a quarantined individual. Others find it more convenient to attend online due to some outside factors in their lives. This brings extra stress to me, the TA, because I always need to have the videoconference up and running each class. It also brings extra stress on the group members who chose to attend in-person, because now they must communicate to everyone in the classroom but also with their teammates who are online. I hear a lot of students having to repeat themselves for their online teammates. This leads into my perceived cons of hybrid courses:</p>

<h3>Cons of Hybrid courses:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For students:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Teamwork breakout sessions are difficult to contribute w/ in person students</li>
        <li>Online courses are harder to pay attention to overall </li>
    </ul>
      <li>For professors:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring all students are heard/attended to</li>
      <li>Not knowing who will be in-person or online on any given day</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>However, some of these cons depend on the actual students within the classroom. I’m sure there are some classrooms and professors where a hybrid style works very well for them. I’m unsure if it’s me and my inexperience with being in a leadership role within a classroom, or if hybrid courses are just difficult to do correctly, but my experiences with hybrid classes and summer camps have been pretty tough experiences. </p>

<p>I'm not saying that it's all bad when it comes to TA-ing. Just the other day, two of my students saw me walking to our class and asked if they could join me. We chit-chatted, they asked me a lot of questions, and I went to class knowing a little bit more about them.
I'm glad that after a year and some change of being online,
I'm able to connect with some of my students and learn about their lives outside of my classroom.</p>
