<p>Hello there! My name is Makayla Moster and I am currently a third year PhD student at Clemson University studying Computer Science. I'm testing out this blogging thing and figured I should
introduce myself, my research interests, and what this blog will (possibly) be about.</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>I grew up in a small town north of Dallas, Texas, whose name you've probably never heard of. After graduating from high school, I moved to North Carolina to pursue
my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). While at UNCW, I realized that I didn't want a 9-5 desk job
and the idea of being a college professor appealed to me. So I applied to grad school to pursue my PhD and was accepted to Clemson University, where I am currently
 attending with the hopes of becoming a college professor one day.</p>

<h2>What do I research?</h2>
 <p>Good question. I have many interests. Currently, I'm interested in Computer Science/Software Engineering education, and I also have interests
 in accessibility and remote work relating to software engineering as well. <br> <br> Feel free to check out my <a href="../research.html">publications page</a> for my current research projects!</p>

 <h2>What is this blog?</h2>
 <p>Another really good question. I don't know just yet. I have many ideas, the first being an inspiration for me to try new recipes and talk about them each week. Another idea is to talk into the void
   about my grad school experiences (and beyond eventually). I also occasionally craft things (crochet), read books, try new recipes (we already talked about that one), website creation/maintenance, and programming
    interesting projects. So really,
 this blog is about talking about the things I tried, hence the name <strong>Grad Student tries <code>#Something</code></strong>. The hashtag/pound symbol is how comments are made in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>,
 which was the very first programming language I learned and a fitting placeholder for the things I'm trying through this blog. I'm sure the programmers reading this blog will appreciate and know that we all, at some point,
have put a comment like <code>#something</code> somewhere in our code.</p>

 <h2>Why should I read this blog?</h2>
 <p>I have no reason why you should or shouldn't. I'm sure posts will be posted non-regularly since I am still a student and busy doing grad student things like research and TA-ing. I plan to talk about a multitude of different topics.
    But I hope that if you do take the time to read this blog, 1. you'll tell me if I'm too boring, 2. you'll learn something new, and 3. I'll have a place to talk about random things I've tried throughout my time
in grad school. And maybe generate some sort of community. Who knows.</p>
