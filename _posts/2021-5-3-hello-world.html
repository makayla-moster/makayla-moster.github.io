Hello World! Welcome to my first blog post! <br><br>

This blog will (more than likely) be a compilation of my time at grad school (and possibly beyond). <!--more--> <br><br>

It was first created as a way to try new recipes, but while creating the blog itself, I decided to incorporate everything that might be included into the title. I hope to use this blog as inspiration to try new recipes and talk into the void about them.
I will also use it for personal stuff - research maybe, school projects, books, experiences, and cool things I learn.

<br><br>

If you have an idea or recipe you wanna share, feel free to <a href="mailto:mmoster@clemson.edu?subject=Blog Idea">email me</a>!
