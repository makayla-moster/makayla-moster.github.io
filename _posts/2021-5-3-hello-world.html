Hello World! Welcome to my first blog post! <br><br>

This blog should probably be called "Grad Student tries Cooking", but ya know. The current plan for this blog is to test recipes found on the internet and maybe some random computer-y or personal things sprinkled in. <br><br>

If there's a recipe you would like me to try, feel free to email me at <a href="<a href="mailto:mmoster@clemson.edu?subject="Test my Recipe">mmoster@clemson.edu</a>!
